                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        My name is Porter Schmidt and I am a student at University of Colorado Boulder studying Creative Technology and Design with a Minor in Computer Science. <br>
                        I am from Park City Utah and grew up there my whole life! I have been skiing there for as long as I can remember.

                    <h2>Experience</h2>
                    <p>
                        When it comes to my experience, I have spent the majority of the time tutoring kids Mathematics and being a Mountains Adventure guide at the Utah Olympic Park and making sure that they are having an enjoyable experience. <br>
                        I am always looking for new oppourtunities ahead to see what I can bring to a new workplace.

                    <p>
                        Trying to be active and enjoying nature is something I am always trying to achieve, as a result this affects some of the hobbies I have. Some of the main ones being Photography, Climbing, and Hiking.
